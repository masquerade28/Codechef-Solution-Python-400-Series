'''
  Chef has recently introduced a feature which allows you to open any userâ€™s submitted code (not just your own), and ask an AI to explain that code in English. 
  For example, you can go to https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/70530506 and click on "Analyse This Code".
  But there is a restriction that the feature works only on codes which are at most 1000 characters long. 
  Given the number of characters, C, in a particular code, output whether the feature is available on this code or not.
'''

# Taking Input For C = Number Of Characters
C = int(input())

# If C Is Less Than Equal To 1000 Character Then Ai Will Be Able To Analyse The Code Else Not
AIAnalysingCode = "YES" if C <= 1000 else "NO"

# Displaying Result
print(AIAnalysingCode)
